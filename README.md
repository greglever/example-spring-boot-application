An example of an application using Spring Boot

In progress...

## Setup
It's probably easiest to install springboot with sdkman, issuing the following command at the terminal:
```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```
then after it's installed:
```
sdk install springboot
```
and issuing the following command:
```
spring --version
```
should give you this output:
```
Spring CLI v1.5.1.RELEASE
```
